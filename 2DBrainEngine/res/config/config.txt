EDITING HELP

(only solid colors will be accepted for collision in the engine)
the top line is the level image, it gets them from the "res" folder in the app (you already passed trough it to get to this file)
To make loading easy, follow this guide: Put your level in the res folder, then edit the first line to say /(YOUR LEVEL FILE NAME).png
If you want more levels and want it to be organized, make a folder in the res folder names levels, then edit the first line to say /levels/(YOUR LEVEL FILE NAME).png
The game will automatically load this level instead.

The next line is more simple, it simply changes how the level draws. if you want a wireframe mode, replace it with wire, else put fill.

The third line is the amount of enemies spawned, the higher this is, the slower the game starts. (i recommend 100-200 for small arenas and double for big ones)

the last line is what music file to play. pretty simple, just put a .WAV file in the sound folder, and put 'sound/(MUSIC FILE NAME HERE).wav' on that last line. remember, the engine can ONLY play .wav files.

Thats it!
Feel free to post any levels online, i will soon add more features, and maybe a mod loader.
